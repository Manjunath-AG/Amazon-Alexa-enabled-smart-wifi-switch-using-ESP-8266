After setting your alexa device to internet!


ask alexa to discover new device

 if error, upload source code twice to node mcu

 if alexa found only 3 outlet, ask alexa to discover device again or you discover device through alexa app in mobile

 then you will find 4 light switch and 4 outlet switch total 8 because source code is written to hand 1,2,4,8 channel relay
          if your using 4 channel relay remove excess 4 switch in alexa app in mobile because its of no use to you
          you can customiz switch name in alexa app, you can also create routine in alexa
          Or you can edit source code in ardino application in desktop (re edit source again and agin, upload it when it works)
 
       - so that it thankyou,
