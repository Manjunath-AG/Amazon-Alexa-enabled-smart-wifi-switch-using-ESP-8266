If to take a look at 4 channel relay
 
 there will be 4 larger cube, each cube represent a relay (8 cube in 8 channel relay)
 
 each relay has 3 output.
 
 middle output is where line of switch board pannel should be connected
 k1 (if its 1st relay) output is where ground of switch board pannel should be connected
 on the other side (that is 3rd output of relay) is always connected, which means even when relay in
 off state, it will be connected (so we dont need it now)
 
 Connection of relay to switch board pannel (safty first, wear glous, and slippers, and turn off main switch board of your house)
   now open any switch board pannel of your chosen room you wish to connect to alexa (that is bedroom, living, study room , kitchen etc

 therefore light,fan,ac,laptop switch all electronic devices main line should be connected to middle output of relay
 and ground of electronic devices should be connected to k output(k1 or k2 or k3 or k4,) relay

 check whether connection or working or not using alexa if yes good you did an awesome work
 
 now if possibel keep adapter,relay,node mcu esp 8266 in side switch board panal, or make your own plastic box and try
 to fit in all the components and fix it to the wall next to switch board ( because it looks cool)


  so thats it, enjoy, be innovative, and invent.
  thankyou for following, ur are greate,
